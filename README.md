# WGS

## Step 1
From raw sequence data to SNPs -> [Sequence processing](https://github.com/Cpetak/WGS/blob/main/sequence_processing.md)

## Step 2
From temporal pH and temperature data to scaled mean and variability -> [Environmental data processing](https://github.com/Cpetak/WGS/blob/main/env_data_processing.R)
